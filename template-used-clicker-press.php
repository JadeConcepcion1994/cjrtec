          <p>Over 80&percnt; of the used machines in the market are discontinued from being manufactured — which means that replacement parts for these machines is hard, or worse, cannot be obtainable anymore. We realize that there may be some good used machines available but if you can't get parts, it's just a matter of time before an expensive investment becomes worthless.</p>

          <p>Quite frankly, this is why there are so many tired and worn out machines on the market. Large manufacturers are dumping their older presses before it's too late and instead are investing in machines with warranties and available parts. They don't want to be the ones holding the bag when an old press finally breaks down.</p>

          <p>If you've been looking at used machines, insist on getting the contact information of the actual manufacturer and call them to verify that they are still in business and is willing to send service information and parts in the event of a break down. Then you should ask the seller to give you a written one-year warranty for your protection.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Be Informed and Be Careful</h2>

      <p class="text-center">We stopped accepting trade-ins in purchasing our new machines because most of the used machines in the market are no longer being manufactured, which means that their parts are no longer available. After getting stuck with our share of used presses, we made the decision that it’s no longer worth the risk.</p>
