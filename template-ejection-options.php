      <p>Ejection methods are as important as the other aspects of die making and maintenance. The idea is to design the die in a way that allows for quick cutting, stripping and re-setup for the next cut. If the material is getting stuck in the cavity of the die every time, it is costing you money.</p>

      <p>The challenge with this is that most of the time, workers are having a hard time utilizing clicker dies for weeks, months and years without saying anything. This is clearly a waste of your money. You should keep a close eye on your die cutting so you can detect tasks that are taking longer than they should.</p>

      Some of the most common ejection choices are <strong>foam</strong>, <strong>cork</strong> and <strong>springs</strong>.
