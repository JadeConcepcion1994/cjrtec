      <p>Steel rule comes in a variety of heights, thicknesses and bevels. Choosing the right steel rule is essential to good die cutting. The thinner the rule, the easier it will cut through your material â€“ however the die will be weaker without backing. The deeper the bevel, the easier the cutting will be also, however the blade will dull faster.</p>

      <p>There is a give and take with all these decisions. If your material is thin, then .937 rule height with backing should work fine, but if your cutting 3&quot; foam, it's simply not going to work. The cavity of the die is not deep enough for the compressed foam.</p>

      <p>There are many types of steel rule. Different thicknesses, different heights and different hardness. Sometimes you choose steel rule because you need a die that is very strong and other times it will be because you need a very tall die cavity. Every cutting objective is different, so there are different types of dies to accommodate the parameters of what your preparing to cut.</p>
