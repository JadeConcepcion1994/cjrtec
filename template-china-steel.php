    <h1>Steel Quality And Clicker Press From China</h1>

    <h2 class="mb-3">When it Comes to Clicker Presses, It’s All About the Steel</h2>

    <p>China has a well-known reputation for re-producing goods of all kinds. Most of these products are of good quality – however when it comes to products produced from steel, China struggles. Simply put, China has an inability to produce quality steel.</p>

    <p class="mb-5">Clicker presses test the limits of steel because they focus tons of pressure onto the surface area of a few square feet of the cutting board. With this kind of force being applied, it is important to think twice about where the machine is manufactured and the type of steel used. It’s interesting to note that the majority of Chinese factories don’t buy presses made in China for this very reason.</p>
